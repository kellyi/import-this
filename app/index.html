                                A friend of mine who knows nearly all the widely used languages uses Python for most of his projects. He says the main reason is that he likes the way source code looks. That may seem a frivolous reason to choose one language over another. But it is not so frivolous as it sounds: when you program, you spend more time reading code than writing it.

This can be verified by disassembling the compiled code and looking for conditional jumps (when compiled with gcc on x86, there are none).
